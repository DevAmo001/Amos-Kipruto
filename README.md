## About Me

I specialize in frontend development, working with technologies such as:

I love transforming designs into beautiful, functional websites and applications that provide great user experiences. I'm also constantly learning and improving my skills, especially in modern JavaScript frameworks and responsive design.

## Skills

- **JavaScript**: Creating dynamic and interactive web applications.
- **React.js**: Building scalable single-page applications (SPAs).
- **Version Control**: Using Git and GitHub for collaboration and project management.
  
 ## Projects

Here are a few of my favorite projects:

### 1. [Number-system-conversion](https://github.com/DevAmo001/Number-system-conversion)
The system converts decimal numbers to binary, octal and hexadecimal numbers and vice versa depending on the type of number system the user choose to convert.
### 2. [Netlix-Website-clone](https://github.com/DevAmo001/Netflix-website-clone)
This project is a "Netflix-inspired website" built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It aims to replicate the core design and user interface of Netflix, offering a smooth and visually appealing experience.While still in development, the clone will feature dynamic content display and responsive design, enhancing both usability and aesthetics.
### 3.[To-do List](https://github.com/DevAmo001/To-Do-List)
A simple To-Do List web app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to add tasks, set specific due dates for each task, and manage their tasks effectively.
### 4.[Rock Paper Scissor](https://github.com/DevAmo001/Rock-Paper-Scissor-Game)
A simple Rock Paper Scissors game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players choose rock, paper, or scissors to compete against a randomly generated computer choice. The game implements basic rules and displays the result instantly.
